MouseTrap

	--Premise--
Our game will be a platformer game. The user will play as a mouse trying to eat food while running from an angry chef. 
The chef is throwing loaves of bread at the mouse to chase it out. 
The goal is to avoid the deadly loaves and eat enough food to move on to the next level. 
The bread will be moving from the right side of the screen at different heights. 

	--Controls--
* Space to Jump  * "A" to move left * "D" to move right * "S" crouch/boost jump * "W" speed boost for a short distance *
* Also Directional Controls work!
	
	--Level Setup--
-Platforms will spawn at different heights and lengths to assist the user in avoiding falling for the first level.
-Bread will spawn in two at time in intervals for level 2.
-Then the platforms will spawn from both sides of the screen with less cheese to collect and more bread spawns. 
The user will use these platforms as a form of progression to keep the user from falling to its death. 
After the user has beaten 3 levels, the game will end and you will be presented with a "Win Screen".
